# Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env to version control

# Sentry Error Tracking & Performance Monitoring
# Get your DSN from: https://sentry.io/settings/[org]/projects/[project]/keys/
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0000000.ingest.sentry.io/0000000

# Sentry Debug Mode (set to true to see Sentry logs in console)
# Default: false (only log errors in production)
VITE_SENTRY_DEBUG=false

# Application Environment
# MODE is automatically set by Vite based on the command:
# - 'development' when running 'pnpm dev'
# - 'production' when running 'pnpm build'
# You typically don't need to set this manually

# Notes:
# 1. All variables MUST be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to client code
# 2. Never use empty prefix (VITE_=) as it exposes all env vars (security risk)
# 3. Restart dev server after changing .env files
# 4. See Vite docs: https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html
